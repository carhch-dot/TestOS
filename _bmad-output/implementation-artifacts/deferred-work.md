  summary: PrismaService's fail-fast on a missing DATABASE_URL has no unit test.
  evidence: One-line guard clause on a hard-to-misconfigure path; no existing pattern in this repo for testing Prisma-extending service constructors in isolation, so the added test scaffolding would be disproportionate to the risk right now.

  summary: Centralize email normalization (trim + lowercase) into one shared helper instead of leaving it inline in bootstrap.service.ts.
  evidence: The epic context calls for normalization to live "in one shared place," but there is currently only one call site (admin bootstrap). Extract to a shared helper when Story 1.2 (login) or 1.7 (invite) adds the second call site — extracting now for a single caller would be a premature abstraction.
